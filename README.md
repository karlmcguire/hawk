Analyzing market data, social media, group chats, through sentiment analysis and
machine learning to predict market manipulation. 

Cryptocurrencies ($200B+ industry) are the wild west of markets. Many people invest
in these projects because they truly believe in them, however, due to their status
as a "legal gray area," market manipulation runs rampant. 

We created a dataset of market data and will use it in combination with sentiment
data from a large amount of influencers and dark-web group chats. We will then
be able to protect investors (or possibly alert exchanges) for market manipulation.

* **calcs** calculates numerical data about the cryptocurrency industry
* **scrape** is a custom web scraper for creating our market dataset
* **twitter** is a script to filter out pertinent tweets from influencers
* **watch** is a telegram bot for analyzing group chats
